# dojo-books
Coding Dojo Optional Flask + MySQL Project

This assignment is for practicing connecting a Flask app to a database, CRUD-ing data from/into said database, and working with many-to-many relationships.

The database schema is based on an earlier ERD/SQL Query assignment called books_schema that had authors and their favorite books.
